## ❓ **Q&A Preparation**

### **Q: "How do you prevent fake accounts?"**

**A:** "Monad's efficiency enables tips as low as $0.01 with minimal gas fees."

### **Q: "How do you scale to millions?"**
**A:** "Monad's 10,000+ TPS handles Twitter-scale natively. We're built for social."

### **Q: "Why not just use Ethereum?"**

### **Q: "What's your moat?"**
**A:** "First-mover on Monad, verified Twitter integration, and proven anti-bot tech."
